# C-file-visualiser-cmd

## Overview

C-file-visualiser-cmd is a project aimed at creating a clone of the `tree` command in Linux. The tool visualizes directories and files in a tree-like structure. Currently, the project supports basic directory traversal.

The main purpose of this project is to improve my C programming skills, particularly in file handling, recursion, and directory manipulation.
